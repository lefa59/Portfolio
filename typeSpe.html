    <p> This project is a series of the different variations of font. When you look at a font there is different widths and heights of the font. This project taught me how to make an image using only words and no images. That it was possible to make a meaningful and interesting piece using just type.
      Here I was able to learn how to use the variations to make a design better. I learned how to kern and space font properly with this assignment.
      This was also a big assignment that I used with Adobe Illustrator that I really wasnâ€™t familiar with at the time.
      Overall, I learned a lot about incorporating font and how important font is for a graphic piece and I also learned a great deal on how to work with Illustrator as well. </p>
